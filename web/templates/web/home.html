                <p>Chetah is a search engine for UN and NGOs reports and it summarizes reports with the state of the art deep learning algorithm, BERT. Users can search by applying filters of UN Clusters. This phase 1 product has reports from IFRC, IWA and UNICEF. It retrieves evidence-based program reports and annual reports. The results have been proven better than the Google and Bing for Non-profit sector, with an F1-score of 0.78. It is developed to help NGO program managers and policy makers to design programs and grant funds. This tool aims to provide better answers for nonprofit work and eventually to help solve the crucial real problems that NGO and UN are facing.</p>

            <p>The UMSI Data4Good center brings together non-profit organizations'
              data into larger datasets for benchmarking and trend analysis.
              Putting data in the hands of nonprofits contributes to the body of knowledge
              about a broad scope of development and relief programs, which in turn will lead
              to better decision-making in nonprofit work.</p>
            <h3 class="ui header">Data4Good's Values</h3>
            <p>The Data4Good center values transparency and equal access to information and data analysis
              that has the potential to impact lives through nonprofit organizations.</p>
